## TRON Super Representation's Nodes from TRONBLOCK

### Plan for hardware expansion
Every server node will be automatically monitored 24/7 with real time operation alerts. We will make sure every server nodes are healthy, which means average CPU utilization rate is below 45%, and peaks below 75%, memory and bandwidth utilization are to be kept below 40% for each server. If the threshold is exceeded, we will upgrade the server hardware, or add more server nodes with proper load balancing.

TRONBLOCK has designated two front-end engineers, two backend engineers and one senior site reliability engineer to support the Tron Super Representatives, contribute to the Tron community, and actively develop TRX related tool chains, e,g, wallet, voting, etc.

## Server Location
Every Tron Super representative node is running in a secure cloud center, across the world ( Singapore, North America, and Europe).
